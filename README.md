# FocusEye
A streamlit website which detects and alarms phones when you are setting up a learning session.
This project is easy, so i think it's not super necessary to explain how it works. Overall, I use OpenCV for webcam.
Then, i combine it with YOLO algorithm with pre-trained model to complete the detection of phones. Finally, i create a simple streamlit website and upload all of my codes onto the web.


In conclusion, I want to thank you and appreciate it when you spend your time trying out my first project.
